* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://vegindex.readthedocs.io.

The PhenoCam Network
--------------------
The PhenoCam Network is a project designed to study the seasonal variations (Phenology) of vegetation.  The project website is at `https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/ <https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu>`_.  The network consists of many cameras collecting images of various types of vegetation.  By analysing the images we can quantify the seasonal changes at a particular site.
